# MNIST-deep-learning_Final_Project
 A deep learning project for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project demonstrates how to use deep learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using  TensorFlow

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Project Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization and reshaping of the images.
- **Training:** The model is trained using Adam optimizer.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved 98 % accuracy on the test set.
